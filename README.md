## 🚀 Vision
In an era of digital-first finance, traditional rule-based systems are obsolete. SentryAi utilizes **Machine Learning** to detect subtle anomalies in transaction patterns (Time, Amount, and V1-V28 PCA features), offering a probabilistic approach to credit security.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🔍 Real-Time Surveillance**: Analyze transactions instantly with low-latency inference.
- **🧠 Random Forest Intelligence**: Optimized classifier trained on the highly imbalanced Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
- **⚡ Nexus UI**: A premium, dark-themed dashboard designed for financial security operators.
- **🏗️ Cloud-Native**: Fully containerized with Docker and optimized for Hugging Face Spaces.
- **📊 Probability Indexing**: Get a granular risk percentage for every transaction, not just a binary flag.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Core**: Python 3.11+
- **ML Engine**: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- **Backend API**: Flask
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS, Glassmorphic CSS Engine
- **Deployment**: Docker, Hugging Face

## 📥 Installation

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd credit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare the Brain (Training)
The model requires the `creditcard.csv` dataset. Once downloaded, run the training pipeline:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
*This will generate `models/fraud_model.pkl` and `models/scaler.pkl`.*

### 3. Launch Surveillance
```bash
python app.py
```
Access the dashboard at: `http://localhost:7860`

## 🐳 Docker Deployment
For production-grade environments, use the included Docker configuration:

```bash
docker build -t sentryai-engine .
docker run -p 7860:7860 sentryai-engine
```

## 🔐 Security Note
The `creditcard.csv` dataset is excluded from final deployment images. Only the trained weights and normalization scalers in the `models/` directory are required for operation, ensuring a lightweight and secure production environment.
